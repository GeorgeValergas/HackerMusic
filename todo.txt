* Put in station information
* Abstract out config settings - default users, db name, icecast info, etc
* Display currently playing song in layout
* Move 'upcoming' to layout
* Add voted_at field, secondary sorting based on timestamp to queue
* Reorganize song list into partial, put browsing stuff into layout
* Add browsing by track, artist, album, genre, etc
* Add admin section for create / delete users, reset passwords
* Possibility for multiple votes
* Vote archiving
* Better design
* README / setup instructions
* Use filename / dir names when taglib returns nothing
* make admin section more REST-y
* Run on Thin / MySQL for better handling

IDEAS:
- Logic to prevent multiple plays / day
- Skip current song option
- itunes library importer option
- default playlist file instead of random selections
